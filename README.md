# RE2REmakeSRT
An SRT (SpeedRun Tool) for Resident Evil 2 (2019).

See the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file for downloads and changes.

All builds from me will be digitally signed as 'Travis J Gutjahr'.

Features anticipated:

* Health as an integer w/ poison indicator.
* IGT (In-Game Timer).
* Inventory display.
* Enemy/boss HP display.

Notice: Not all planned features will be available upon initial release. Some features may be cancelled due to practicality or other issues. This list is not intended to be a guarantee.
