### [Download 1.1.7.0 Beta](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1170-Beta-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-10)
* Added --NoInventory option to disable the inventory display. This option also exists in the Options UI. Upon setting this setting you must restart the SRT.

### [Download 1.1.6.1 Beta](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1161-Beta-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-10)
* Fixed a bug where Always on Top would steal focus away from the new Options UI.

### [Download 1.1.6.0 Beta](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1160-Beta-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-10)
* Added options UI as a context menu. Right-click anywhere on the user interface and selection Options to open the dialog.

### [Download 1.1.5.2 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1152-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-09)
* Enemy HP is now sorted by percentage. Enemies which have been damaged will show up at the top of the list to better help you see which enemies you're engaging.
* Raw IGT value is now hidden. You can show this value again by using the --Debug command-line argument. The human-readable IGT still shows by default.

### [Download 1.1.5.1 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1151-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-08)
* Fixed a bug where the program would crash and not open if a --ScalingFactor was not set.

### [Download 1.1.5.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1150-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-07)
* Added --Transparent which sets the background to be transparent.
* Added ScalingFactor=n which defines what the size of an inventory icon will be relative to the original size where n is a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.75 (75%).

Notes: Using --No-Titlebar --Always-On-Top --Transparent will allow the SRT to function LIKE an in-game overlay. It is not an overlay in technical terms but it will fit the request without using DirectX 2D drawing and additional custom code.

### [Download 1.1.4.3 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1143-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-06)
* Potential fix for inventory display bugs that were happening mid to late game and after auto-save loading/continuing.
* Initial code for --No-Titlebar and --Always-On-Top support. It works but there is no transparency yet so it is not ideal yet.

### [Download 1.1.4.2 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1142-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-04)
* Fixed some incorrectly mapped weapons. The attachment portion was mapped incorrectly and caused Red X error images to be displayed for Spark Shot and Chemical Flamethrower.

### [Download 1.1.4.1 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1141-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-04)
* Fixed (potentially) the inventory weirdness that happens occasionally.

### [Download 1.1.3.1 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1131-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-04)
* Added some sanity checking for invalid Item/Weapon IDs in the inventory display. It now shows a red X when these are encountered.
* Added some sanity checking for invalid Slot IDs. It now skips any inventory entry with a Slot ID not within 0 through 19.

### [Download 1.1.3.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1130-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-04)

### [Download 1.1.2.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1120-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-03)
* Added resizing/scaling to the inventory icons. Set to 75% of the original size so the inventory doesn't take up so much screen space.

### [Download 1.1.1.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1110-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-03)

### [Download 1.0.5.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1050-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-01-31)
